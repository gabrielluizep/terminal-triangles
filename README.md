# terminal-triangles
## Code Challenge

The challenge consists in develop an algorithm in C that receives two entries, triangle height (`H`) and number of triangles (`N`), and print on the terminal `N` triangles, each triangle having the width and height `H`. The triangle must be printed on the terminal using characters as follow the example:



```bash
How many triangles should be printed on the terminal?

`DoD:`

- Receiving the inputs from the user using `do while`;
- Triangle correctly drawn, with the correct height and each line increasing the number of characters by one;
- Repeating the drawning of the triangles to match the user input.
